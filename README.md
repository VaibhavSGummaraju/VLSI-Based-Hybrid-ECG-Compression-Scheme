# VLSI-Based-Hybrid-ECG-Compression-Scheme
Here’s a 300-character version of your text:  The project “VLSI-Based Hybrid ECG Compression Scheme” presents a power-efficient, lossless algorithm combining Adaptive Golomb-Rice Coding and Run-Length Encoding, achieving high compression ratios and low complexity for reliable ECG data storage and transmission in medical devices.





Samples.csv is the set of ECG signals obtained from the bank (used ML II).

Output.txt is the input file considered  after sampling the data (x 10,000) and converted to binary format.

Synthesis.txt is the procedure to obtain reports for the file withoutclk.v.
